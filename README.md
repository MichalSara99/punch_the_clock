# Punch The Clock
Simple Flask web app for clocking in/out. It is dedicated to my mom.

## Database
Assumes MYSQL database. The app itself does not create the tables being used inside. One has to create them which should not be a problem as the Models hints on the db fields and its types. 

## Interface

Timesheet view
